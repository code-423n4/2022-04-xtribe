so each user deploys their own safe and they are the only one who can interact with it (besides the modules for some functions)? Because the safe's default authority only allows calls from the router and the router checks that the caller is the safe owner?


[02/20/2022 5:51 PM] joeysantoro
The default authority manages access, which in this case includes the router and savior. As the owner, the user can change or remove the authority to set their own policy


[02/20/2022 6:15 PM] cmichel
ok so if they open the safe up for everyone, you expect the safe users not to use the router because there's still the `authenticate` (`caller == safe owner`)restriction on it?


[02/20/2022 9:26 PM] joeysantoro
Yeah the router wouldn’t work in that case

Lol omg, 1st time seeing that. Your code is **amazingly** squeaky clean.
I'm used to writing long QA reports & long gas reports. Well... Let's say that I'm very curious about how this could be optimized further 😄 
Well done dear sponsor :hi5:

Can the tests in `lib/ds-test` be run? What are the installation steps?


[04/21/2022 9:20 AM] vad37
Quick test way
clone the sub gitmodule original repo https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-xtribe/blob/main/.gitmodules
install foundry: https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html
Pull git submodule: `git submodule update --init`
Build: `forge build`
Test with `forge test`
Then do the same thing again for xTRIBE, flywheel and ERC4626

Its just an optional module, no boosters are currently in use


[04/25/2022 8:14 PM] joeysantoro
Please @me so I get a notification if anyone has questions!


[04/26/2022 2:55 AM] teryanarmen
@Joey S Is there a contract that implements IRewardStream that we can look at?


[04/26/2022 3:18 AM] joeysantoro
not at the moment, but assume it always transfers exactly the amount of tokens it returns in the function call

@Joey S Is `FlywheelStaticRewards` in scope? Noticed that it was part of the quantstamp report but isn't listed in this contest scope


[04/26/2022 3:40 PM] 0xdjango
Hey @Joey S are the `ERC4626Router` contracts in scope?
